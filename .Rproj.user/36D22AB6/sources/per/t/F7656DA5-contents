## Hello

For grading, the 3rd slide is code with image with highlighted code, the 4th slide is an image, and the 5th slide is two columns. These are the additional 4 features too.

-   Incremental lists (this one right here)

-   Slide transitions, there will be one to the next slide

-   Footer below each slide

-   Footnote[^1]

[^1]: A footnote

## Some code from L04 {.smaller .scrollable transition="slide"}

The highlighted line is what makes the scale colors different (viridis)

US_income <- mutate(
  US_income,
  income_bins = cut(
    ifelse(is.na(median_income), 25000, median_income),
    breaks = c(0, 40000, 50000, 60000, 70000, 80000),
    labels = c("< $40k", "$40k to $50k", 
               "$50k to $60k", "$60k to $70k", "> $70k"),
    right = FALSE
  )
)
```

       aes(state = name, fill = income_bins)) +

  theme_statebins() +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  labs(fill = "Median\nIncome")
